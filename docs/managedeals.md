Deal Room
=========

*Deal rooms* is one of the important functionality in the Yappes platform.

It acts as an private negotiation tool for the API Provider and the
Consumer to chat in realtime to discuss on the pricing, customizing the
quota, license, etc.

Each Deal will be private to only the parties invloved in the negotation.
