# Deal Room

Deal rooms is one of the important functionality in the Yappes platform.
It acts as an private negotiation tool for the API Provider and the
Consumer to chat in realtime to discuss on the pricing, customizing the
quota, license, etc

Deals are created as explained under the section [\"Consume
API\"](consume_api).Each Deal will be private to only the parties
invloved in the negotation.
