# Publish API

Once the API is created, it needs to be published in order for it to be
available for consumers during the search or discovery process.

Below are the steps to be followed to Publish the API:

1.  Click on the \"Dashboard\" Link

    your api

4.  Things to remember before publishing an api.
    -   API must be having atleast one tag.
    -   Atleast one resource end point must be added to your api.

5.  If the API is already Published, then there will be button
    \"UNPUBLISH\" will be visible. You can use this button to unpublish
    the API and do some changes and publish it again.

6.  After this we will see how to consume an api in the next section
