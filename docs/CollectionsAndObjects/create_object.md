Creating Objects
================

**Creating an Object**

1.  To create the first Object, Click on **Add Object** button/option on
    the top of the Object view.
2.  On click, a modal view opens prompting the user to add properties.
3.  Click on **New** button to define a property.
4.  On clicking **New** button each time, a new property is added to the
    object list with the default name same as the default type (ie:
    String). It can also be noticed that the property details fields
    (Type, Name, Value) on the right corner will be enabled.
5.  Change the property details by selecting the **Type**, specifying
    the **Name** of the property and providing the **Value** for the
    same.
6.  To add multiple properties, click on **New** button and follow steps
    from 3 - 5
7.  From the existing property list, you can click on any particular
    property to view its definition and values and also change
    accordingly if necessary. Property highlighter helps to identify the
    current selection.
8.  Object is created and thus the details of the same will be rendered
    in the Object view.
