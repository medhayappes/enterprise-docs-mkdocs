Updating Objects
================

**Updating an Object**

-   To update a specific object, click on the **Edit** button at the end
    of the property details of the object.
-   In the Update Object modal, all the properties including the
    property details from the previous Object creation, as well as the
    current property details will be obtained with its associated values
    to be modified.
-   **Note:** The highlighting factor of the Object updating is that,
    once an Object has been selected to be updated, all the property
    details (property name and property type) are retained or reused
    during further object updation with empty property values by
    default. Point to consider here is that, user cannot delete an
    existing property and also cannot modify existing property type or
    the existing property name but can either use a particular property
    by specifying the value or ignore them and create new properties.
-   You can utilize the exiting properties by clicking on them and
    providing the value.
-   Once the changes are done, you can click on the UPDATE button.
-   Object's property details will be updated accordingly and can be
    seen in the object list
-   After this we will be looking in to Reporting an API
