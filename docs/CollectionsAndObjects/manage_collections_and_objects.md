Manage Collection and Objects
=============================

API created have access to two different data sources - Local and
Remote. Local data sources are maintained in Yappes itself and can be
accessed during the API creation. Remote data sources are maintained
outside Yappes and can be accessed through our custom defined Remote
Endpoints. Collections and Objects are used to access the data locally.

Under this section we will see in detail, [How to Create/Update
Collections?](create_update_delete_collection) and [How to Create/Update
Objects?](create_update_delete_object)

To manage Collections, you first have to redirect to the collection
view.

-   Click on Dashboard from the top menu. This will render the Dashboard
    view.
-   From the available group of options placed in the left corner of the
    screen, click on **Collection** option. This renders the Collection
    view to further manage Collections.
-   You will now see the Collection view, where one can create/update a
    collection.
