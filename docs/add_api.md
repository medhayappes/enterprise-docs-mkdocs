Create an Existing API
======================

It is very easy to on-board an API to our Yappes platform. If you have
an working API, then just follow the below steps to on-board an API.

All the APIs will be managed under Dashboard which we will study in
detail in the section ["What is in My Dashboard?"](dashboard.md).

1.  Login to the Yappes Application
2.  Click on the "Dashboard" Link Or Click on "Onboard your api" in
    HomePage and goto [Step 5](#5)
