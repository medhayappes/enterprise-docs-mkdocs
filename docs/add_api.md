Onboading an Existing API
======================

It is very easy to on-board an API to our Yappes platform. 

**Simple Steps for Onboarding an Existing API**

1. Create **Yappe API** for selecting type as  **Existing API** with Name,Baseurl & a short description.
2. Set up of  enviornment details for development, test & production.
3. Test connection between  created *Yappe API* and your API hostname/baseurl.
4. Add tags & subtags
5. Add resources like Swagger details & Authentication.
6. Add Endpoints
7. Publish

All the APIs will be managed under Dashboard which we will study in
detail in the section [What is in My Dashboard?](dashboard.md).
