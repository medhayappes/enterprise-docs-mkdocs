Adding Multiple Endpoints
=========================

This is one of the important feature. If you have Swagger Spec
file(JSON) for your API, then you can add multiple endpoints in one go.

First click on "UPLOAD" button and a dialog will be opened for you to
add the details

        API
3.  Yappes Version
4.  Next - click on "Next" and then select the Swagger Spec file(JSON)
    of your API and upload it
5.  Now you have successfully uploaded the endpoints and you can see all
    the endpoints you have uploaded.

    as mentioned in the previous section ["Add an
    Endpoint"](addendpoint).
7.  Now we know creating endpoints individually and uploading it as a
