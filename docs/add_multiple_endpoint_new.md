Adding Multiple Endpoints
=========================

This is one of the important feature. If you have Swagger Spec
file(JSON) for your API, then you can add multiple endpoints in one go.

First click on **UPLOAD** button and a dialog will be opened for you to
add the details

4.  Next - click on **Next** and then select the **Swagger Spec file(JSON)**
    of your API and upload it

    as mentioned in the previous section [**Add an
