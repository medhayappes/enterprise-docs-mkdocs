Associate API with Organizations
================================

Yappes provides the "Organization" feature to organize and manage the
APIs in a controlled manner. In the previous section we have seen the
different funtionalities as part of the Organization. Now we see how to
associate and disassociate an API with respect to Organization. One API
can be associated with only one Organization.

1.  In this section, We are going to see how to associate API on the
    time of creation.    
    **Note: For associating API with the Organization, You must be
    having "owner" or "api-creator" role in that Organization. Only you
    can associate API with your owned organization.**

    the dropdown New API and Existing API.    
    **Note: For New API and Existing API the Procedures are same for
    associating of API with the organization.**
