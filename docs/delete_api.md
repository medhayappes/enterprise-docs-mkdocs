Delete API
==========

Our Platform provides the feature to delete the APIs owned by the user.

Deletion of an API will remove it completely from the system including
the assosicated resources as well like environments, tags, endpoints,
etc. Delete API process is same for existing API and new API. We
recommend Users to change the ownership of the API rather than deleting
the API.

1.  User Should click on 'Dashboard' and then select the API by clicking
    on the 'View' button.
2.  Scroll Down in the 'API Details' tab, User will be able to see the
    'Delete API' and 'Change Ownership' functionalities in bold red
    colour.
3.  Click on the Delete API button.Then You will be prompted that 'Are
    you sure you want to delete this API?'
4.  After this we will see How to Change the Ownership of an API ["Next
    :Change the Ownership of an API"](change_api_ownership)
