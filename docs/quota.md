Quota
=====

Default Quota is used to the limit the transactions for trying out by
the consumers before they subscribe to your API.

API Provider can use it to define the "Number of Transactions" and the
"Quota Period".

By Default the number of transaction enabled will be 100 / month
whenever the API is created.
