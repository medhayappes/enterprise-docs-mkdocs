2.  After clicking, it will display all the deal details like Deal
    Name(Consumer UserName/API Name), Consumer and Status. Status can be
    changed only by the API Provider and not by the API Consumer. Status
    for deals can be changed by selecting the dropdown. Different status
    for a deal are :

    -   In-progress
    -   Closed
    -   Rejected
    -   Deal Accepted

    **Deal Accepted**, which we will be discussing in detail in the
    section [**API Subscriptions**]subscriptions.md)
