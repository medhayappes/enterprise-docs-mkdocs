Start or Stop API Subscriptions
===============================

Consumer can subscribe to an API in two ways depending upon the Pricing
Plan of the API.

1.  If the Pricing Plan is "Free", then the consumer can directly click
    on the subscribe button under the "Pricing" tab and Start using the
    API
2.  If the Pricing Plan is either "Freemium" or "Paid", then the
    subscription will be done by the API Provider through the Deal
    process which we discussed in detail under section [Manage
    Deals-Provider](providerdeals)

1.  Provider can start the Subscription of the API once the status is
    "Deal Accepted". To enable subscription, change deal status to 'Deal
    Accepted', On changing, there will be a button "START SUBSCRIPTION"
    activated to enable the subscription.

2.  On clicking "START SUBSCRIPTION" button, it will list the available
    pricing plans which have been created earlier.

3.  Provider can also make a custom plan for that consumer alone using
    custom plan.

    And here after the successfull subscribed to the api you can see
    button called View Subscription Details button.In the next page we
    can see what are all the things we can do with the View Subscription
    Details.

6.  Subscriptions can be stopped in two ways:
    1.  If the Pricing Plan type of the subscribed API is either
        "Freemium" or "Paid", then only API Provider can stop the
        subscription. API Consumer cannot directly stop the
        subscription.To stop subscription, click on stop subscription
        button as shown. It will unsubscribe the user from the existing
        plan.

    2.  If the Pricing Plan type of the subscribed API is "Free", then
        API Consumer can directly stop the subscription.To stop
        subscription, the consumer needs to navigate to
        "Dashboard-&gt;Subscriptions" tab. Under the "Free APIs" tab,
        Click on the Unsubscribe button for the API which you want to
        unsubscribe.
