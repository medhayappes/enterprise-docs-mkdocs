Managing Endpoints
==================

Yappes gives facility to Users to manage the Endpoints of their API's in a simple
and detailed way. 

Users can create and configure Endpoints with the
details like path, methods and content-type. 

Users can even add **Custom
Logic** for the endpoints supported with the **Custom** and **Standard
Javascript objects** for easy implementation. 

Users can also add the
documentation and test their endpoints right away.
