# Managing Endpoints

Yappes provides Users to manage the Endpoints of their API\'s in a
simple and detailed way. Users can create and configure Endpoints with
the details like path, methods and content-type. Users can even add
Custom Logic for the endpoints supported with the Custom and Standard
Javascript objects for easy implementation. Also Users can add the
documentation and test right away their endpoints.\
We will see in detail how to create and configure the endpoints

Once you have successfully created the API, next step is to create the
endpoints.
