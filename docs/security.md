Each API created in Yappes is marked with an unique signature hash-key
called as **\"Platform Identity Key\"**.

This Platform Identity Key will get attached itself as the x-yappes-key
header, when the request is routed through Yappes platform. API
Providers can validate whether the request is coming from Yappes
platform or not using the x-yappes-key value.
