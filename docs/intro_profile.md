User Profile
============

Profile is a collection of all the neccessary information about an
registered user which helps in collaboration within the platform. The
information ranges from personal information like Name, UserName,
EmailId to Social Information like Twitter, Facebook, Github,
Stackoverflow etc.

1.  User can provide detailed information about him/her like
    Personal(Name, UserName..),Social information(twitter, facebook,
    github..) etc. These information will be visibile to other platform
    users as part of the API you have published.
2.  Each API available in search/discovery will include the Username of
    the person who published the API as well.Clicking the Username will
    display the information about the provider which we will study in
    detail in the section ["API Provider Profile"](apiProviderProfile)
3.  We will cover the detailed profile view in the next section ["Next :
    My User Profile"](userProfile)
