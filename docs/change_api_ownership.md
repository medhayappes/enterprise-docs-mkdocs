# API Ownership Change

By default the Creator of the API is the Owner of it.So the owner has
the power to pass the ownership of API to other user in platform.

If the API is not associated to any organisation then the ownership can
be given to anyone in the platform. Otherwise the ownership can be given
to the member of the organisation only (member should have role as
\'api-creator\').

1.  User Should click on \'Dashboard\' and then select the API by
    clicking on the \'View\' button.
2.  Scroll Down in the \'API Details\' tab, User will be able to see the
    \'Delete API\' and \'Change Ownership\' in bold red colour.
3.  On pressing the \'Change Ownership button\', modal will be
    opened.The user should enter the emailId of the respective user for
    whom the ownership will be passed on to.

    OWNERSHIP\'

    wan to Change the Ownership of the API?\'
