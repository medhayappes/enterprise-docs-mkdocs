CLI Tools
=========

Developer can use our CLI tool to work on the business logic on their
local machine itself and can sync with the Yappes cloud.

As developers, coding in their local machine with own choice of IDE will
be very easy and efficient. To make this possible, we have introduced
"yappescli" CLI tool which comes up with all basic and needed commands
to modify, test and deploy the business logic for an endpoint.

### Authentication

-   CLI tool uses token based authentication for communication with the
    Yappes.com
-   Users needs to login with their Yappes EmailId and Password.
-   The auth token is stored under users home directory.

Next we will see the list of commands available as part of the
"yappescli" tool.
