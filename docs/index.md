# Introduction

Yappes Enterprise Platform (YEP) is an enterprise-grade platform and
provides components to enable and manage the digital enterprise of today
and the future. YEP is the next generation unified platform to manage
the end-to-end API lifecycle.

It combines a developer engine - focused on rapidly building, testing
and deploying APIs; an API marketplace (developer portal) for efficient
discovery, seamless integration and controlled distribution of APIs; an
API Gateway to orchestrate micro services, and provide governance and
mediation of APIs; a management and analytics dashboard to provide an
enterprise view of all the APIs and critical metrics; and a monitoring
mechanism to ensure the liveliness and health of the APIs.

YEP provides multi-dimensional security such as authorization,
authentication, message signature, RBAC, onboarding of
customers/partners/vendors etc.

YEP is sector and cloud agnostic and can be deployed on any public or
private cloud or on-premises infrastructure.
