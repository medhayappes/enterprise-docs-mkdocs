# Pricing Details

Under Pricing tab the API providers can set the pricing plans for their
APIs. Our Yappes platform provides three type of plans.

-   FREE - If API is public and free, then this plan type can be
    selected and customized
-   PAID - If API is public and not free, then this plan type can be
    selected and accordingly customized as per the need
-   FREEMIUM - If API is public and free for some request and charges
    extra use, then this plan type can be selected and customized

The Pricing plans are broadly classified as two groups

-   Public - All the Pricing plans created under pricing section will be
    a public plan, which means it will be available to all the users who
    are viewing the API
-   Private - The customized Pricing plans created as part of the deal
    process, will be visible only between the parties(Provider/Consumer)
    involved in the deal.

Once the Pricing Plan is created, it needs to be **\"Activated\"** to
make it available to the public.

The activated Pricing Plan can later be deactivated by clicking on the
button \"DEACTIVATE\", which makes the pricing plan to be hidden from
the platform users.

Provider can choose not disclose the pricing details and ask all the
user to contact for price details.If this is the case, then provider can
enable or disable \"Always contact for pricing\" by
Checking/UnChecking.If this checkbox is \"checked\" then

-   The consumer who wants to consume that API has to contact the API
    provider using our Deal Room by clicking on the \"CONTACT\" button.
    We will discuss about deals in detail under the section [\"How Deal
    Room Works?\"](managedeals).
-   None of the Pricing plan will be visible for the user
