Configure Error Settings
========================

Let us start our configuration with User level - Dev

**User Level - Dev**  

1.  Click on the radio button Dev under user level configuration. By
    default, error settings is configured to **Dev**
2.  Now, select from the drop down, the log levels (debug, error, info)
3.  click on **Save** button to save the error settings.
4.  If the custom logic contains syntactical or any error in business
    logic, the error stack is sent from the server so that the user is
    well aware and understand the cause of the error  
    For example: If you test your erroneous logic code, you can expect
    the error format similar to the below picture.

**User Level - Customer**  

1.  Click on the radio button **Customer** under user level
    configuration.
2.  Now, select from the drop down, the log levels (debug, error, info)
3.  On Customer user level selection, a separate section is rendered to
    configure custom error message. Configure this with **Error Status**
    and **Error Message**
4.  click on **Save** button to save the error settings.
5.  If the custom logic contains syntactical or any error in business
    logic, for the customer's convenience only a brief error message is
    sent from server so that later the customer can inform the API
    provider with the same.  
    For example: If you test your erroneous API logic, you can expect
    the error format similar to the below picture.
