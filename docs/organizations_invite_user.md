Invite User to Organizations
============================

Organization owner can invite other Yappes users to be part of the
Organization. Each invited user will be automatically added as part of
the Organization with the default role as "api-reader". Organization
Owner can later remove the user from the Organization as well. Now let
us see how we can invite users to the Organization.

1.  After clicking the Organization setting button you are in the
    Organizations View Detail page. Here you can find the INVITE USERS
    button under the people tab

5.  Once the user association is successful, you find the invited user
    under the people tab **Note: The default invited user has the role
    as api-reader and the only owner can change the role of the invited
    user**
